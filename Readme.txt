1. Clone the repo 
2. Create a Django Project ( Create using Pycharm IDE Very easy to do that)
3. After you create switch to the folder where manage.py is present through terminal and run "Python manage.py runserver"
4. Then go to a web browser and say http://localhost:8000/query/#
5. Select all the required fields from the left side of the query page such as Vendor , Start date, Start time, End date, End time, Intersection and Vehicle
6. On the right side of the graph select which graphs you want to see and click generate Graph.
7. Select and deselect as and when what graph you want to see

Issues
1. The date selected is dynamic by the user but the data retrived is for 31st of Jan 2021 ( Currently static)
2. Vehicles are being selected but the data retrived is not according to that. Should update that.
